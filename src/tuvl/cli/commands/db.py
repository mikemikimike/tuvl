"""``tuvl db`` subcommands for multi-tenant Row-Level Security maintenance.

Subcommands
-----------
* ``tuvl generate rls``  \u2014 print the idempotent RLS SQL to stdout (or a
  file via ``--out``).  Operators review and apply it through their normal
  migration tooling.
* ``tuvl verify rls``     \u2014 connect to the configured primary datasource
  and report which tenant tables are missing the
  ``tuvl_tenant_isolation`` policy.  Exits non-zero when policies are
  missing so it composes with CI / startup gates.

Both subcommands honour the active project's ``.tuvl/system.yaml`` locked
deployment mode \u2014 generation succeeds in any mode (useful for previewing
what would be emitted), but the bootstrap warning hint and the check
command are most meaningful under ``multi_tenant``.

    ``tuvl.core.config.settings`` is a module-level singleton built the first

    setting ``TUVL_PROJECT_DIR`` alone would not change ``settings.project_dir``
    for an already-constructed singleton. We update the singleton's field
    in place (the same technique the test suite already uses via
    ``monkeypatch.setattr(settings, "tuvl_project_dir", ...)``) so every
    downstream consumer of ``settings.project_dir`` / ``settings.dir_for(...)``
